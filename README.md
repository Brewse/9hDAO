# 9hDAO
In the spirit of hic et nunc we are developing 9hDAO as a platform to connect artists with the 9hDAO collectors collective. In an exciting and interactive way.

Our mission is to make a difference in artists lives, one artist at a time,
by selecting (1) artist each month to support by purchasing their artwork.

We want to be able to contribute to the success of the HEN community.

(9) hDAO represents roughly $200.00 USD and that amount of money is equal to many of HEN artist’s monthly salaries. Thank you for taking time to read our litepaper and we hope that you will join us!
